## Run CSRS Portal Locally with Docker Compose

   1. Navigate to the project root:
    cd jag-csrs-portal-public\

   2. Build the containers (API, Frontend, etc.):
    docker compose build

   3. Start the containers:
    docker compose up

   4. To shut everything down cleanly:
    docker compose down

   5. To force a rebuild (use after Dockerfile changes):
    docker compose down && docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up

    ðŸš¨ Known issue on Windows:
    You may need to trust the development certificate if the backend uses HTTPS.

    Run the following once:
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust

## Debug CSRS API Locally with VS

    1. If breakpoints arenâ€™t hit during debugging, ensure Dockerfile includes .pdb files and that -c Debug is set during build/publish.

    2. To attach the debugger in VS  to the jag-csrs-api process running inside Docker (Linux Container, Docker type)

    3. Select Docker debug profile

    4. For Connection type select Docker (Linux Container)

    5. For Connection target select jag-csrs-api

    6. Filter processes ( 'dotnet') and select the process
