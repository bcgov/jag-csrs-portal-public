                        <p>In B.C., the amount of child support to be paid is determined using 
                          <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/divorce/family-justice/family-law/child-support/guidelines">the Child Support Guidelines</a>.  
                          As a general rule, the law requires courts, parents and the Child Support Recalculation Service to 
                          use the guidelines.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Even if you're not sure if the income of the other parent has changed, the recalculation service 
                          can review your order or written agreement each year to ensure it is fair based on the most recent 
                          ncome tax information and the Child Support Guidelines.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Each year, the recalculation service will ask the paying parent to provide their income tax 
                          information for the most recent tax year.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>In some situations, the recalculation service will ask both parents to provide this information 
                          if their child support order or written agreement used both incomes to determine support.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                          If income tax information is not provided by the time it is required, the recalculation service 
                          can add at least 10% or more to the income amount set out in the most recent order or 
                          recalculation statement and then recalculate the amount of child support based on the increased 
                          income amount.  The rate of increase will depend on the date the most recent order was made or 
                          last recalculated when income was reviewed.
